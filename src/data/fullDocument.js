COURSE DESCRIPTION:<br>
Our course is intended to examine the psychological concept of gender in historical and contemporary perspectives. Much of the world defaults to a male perspective, and psychological inquiry is no exception. One of our objectives will be to think outside of a male-centric box. We will work to pull at the threads of stereotype and sexism that is woven into our psychology.  A few of the topics we will discuss include development, self-concept, social relations, and institutions. Some specific course objectives include:
<ul>
<li>Recognize and appropriately use central terminology of gender psychology</li>
<li>Be familiar with meaningful sex and gender differences</li>
<li>Understand factors that contribute to any functional differences</li>
<li>Comprehend that gender is something we do as much as something we have</li>
<li>Examine systemic inequities based on gender, race, status, and their intersections</li>
<li>Connect the psychology of gender to real world experiences</li>
</ul>

In this course, we recognize that gender does not exist in isolation but intersects with other aspects of identity such as race, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, and ability. These intersections shape individual experiences and perspectives in unique ways. By exploring these overlapping identities, we aim to understand the complexity of gender and its influence on psychological processes, ensuring that our discussions and analyses reflect the diversity of human experiences.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

General educational goals of this class (and any class I lead), beyond its particular content, include collaborating with students to expand their knowledge and developing their skills in critical thinking. I am only the architect. I set up our course for exposure and opportunities, but in reality, learning results from what you do and what you think. New information will only matter as it relates to your existing knowledge and experiences. For these reasons, we will have in-class and online discussions  as well as assignments to reflect on and apply course concepts, including student research presentations.

Prior Knowledge and Course Interest Quiz<br>
At the beginning of the course, you will take a quiz that assesses your prior knowledge on foundational knowledge related to the course topic.  The purpose of this quiz is to help the instructor to understand your readiness for the content. It would also give you a chance to indicate your interest in topics that could be discussed in the course. This quiz will be worth 5 points. 


Packback Responses <br>
We will use the Packback platform to explore ideas and life events in relation to course topics and introspect on the way you look at the world. Only a portion of the students in our class will post inquiries (see below). However, every week (starting in our second week) you are expected to post a thoughtful response to your choice of the applied questions on Packback. 
You will be awarded 2.5 points for on-time submissions, which are due Sunday nights at 11:59pm. Responses earn Curiosity points based on their content, length, and use of outside sources. You earn 2.5 points each week for attaining a Curiosity Score of 80 points or more on any response. In sum, you earn up to 70 points for timely, thoughtful responses during the semester (5 points for each weekly response, 14 required). 

On Packback, you will have \‘sparks\’ to give to questions and responses you believe were particularly well-articulated and/or posed intriguing ideas. Sparks must be distributed by Sunday nights. You can earn bonus points depending on the number of sparks you earn from your peers and instructors each week. 

**Assessments**: TopHat and Canvas Quizzes <br>
We will use Canvas quizzes and TopHat questions to check your comprehension of course content as we proceed. TopHat primarily will be answered during class  whereas the quizzes will be completed outside of class and will be available on Canvas for multiple days.  Quizzes are made by multiple choice and short answer questions.  You have two attempts, which will be averaged, on each 10-point quiz; however, you may drop your two lowest quizzes.  We will have a non-cumulative final worth 20 points, so it is possible to drop the final (aka skip taking it).  Final Exam format includes multiple choices and short answer questions.  The total points anticipated for TopHat assessments is 75 , and Canvas quizzes, 130 points, including the final exam, 150 points total. In addition, I also provided a list of reflection questions that relate to the course content after each session. I recommend you review these questions to self-assess your learning before taking the quiz.  
YOU CHOOSE (70 points): A or B

During the first week of class, you will choose which “homework” option you prefer. Each has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of workload and learning. Use the People tab on Canvas to make your selection by January 14. If you choose A, then you will select your topic/week for presenting research. If you choose B, then you will choose your set of weeks for posting Packback inquiries and the media analysis will be assigned to you. Please see Canvas for the list of suggested topics and their corresponding dates.

**Option A**: Research Presentation <br>
Throughout the second half of the semester, self-selected student groups will present concepts and theory on a topic and their own data collection related to it to engage the class in discussion. Not everyone in a group must speak; your group will divide the tasks and complete a contract. Nevertheless, all participants must independently find empirical sources on the topic and submit a brief summary on their contribution by February 8. We will have two days in class set aside for groups to plan their data collection and divide their tasks. The class presentation will be graded for how well it engages the class (--most important), comprehensive overview of the existing research, integration of course concepts, and clear overview of the data collection results in relation to the literature. Each group will have an opportunity to receive feedback from the class and instructor to make improvements on their project. More information about the presentation format and requirements for the group and individual are available on Canvas. Each group will have the opportunity to submit their presentation to be included in the annual Psi Chi Research Conference, which is a great experience for your professional resume, especially if you are considering graduate school.

There are separate group discussion boards on Canvas for your members to interact and plan. As noted above, we will devote two class periods to group planning and preparation (February 9 and 12). If you cannot participate in the group preparation on those days, you will forfeit the points but are still accountable for coordinating with your team. The research summary is worth 20 points, participation in group planning is 10 points, submission and evaluation of the group contract is 5 points, your data contribution is 5 points, and your participation in and quality of the final presentation is 30 points for a total of 70 points for the project.

OR

**Option B**: Packback Inquiries and Media Analysis<br>
This option involves two key tasks: writing two Packback inquiries during the semester and submitting a media analysis. For the media analysis, students will write a brief paper on the potential developmental and socialization impact of 3 to 5 media examples on understanding gender. You will receive feedback for improvements on your written analysis. You can earn up to 50 points for this analysis, which will be due March 17. (Bonus points will be added for submissions before spring break.)  

Packback inquiries should always be open-ended questions. That means there should not be one right answer. Although these must be questions, you should also share information or ideas to facilitate creative and critical thinking of your peers. Your post should be scholarly yet build connections to real world applications and experiences. As a consequence, it is expected that you will integrate outside sources to strengthen both your inquiries (and responses--see ‘Packback instructions’ on Canvas for details). Indeed, you are encouraged to incorporate media and evidence for common experiences with the gender-related topic of the week for your Packback inquiry.

Like Packback responses, you earn 2.5 points for on-time submission of your question to the platform by Sunday night as well as 2.5 points for achieving a Curiosity Score of 80 or more. If your inquiry is moderated (i.e., flagged for revision) in Packback, you have until Wednesday night to make adjustments in order to earn credit without penalty. In addition, questions will be assessed 5 points for quality (--see assignment rubric in Canvas for details). Altogether you can earn 10 points for each inquiry, for a total of 20 points across the semester. 


Course Surveys <br>
During the semester, you will be asked to complete two brief surveys on Qualtrics; both will be anonymous and confidential. This means that your personal information cannot be connected to your responses. The first is a background survey. This is a simple questionnaire for me to get to know a little bit about the class; it is due January 8 (however, it will remain open until January 21) and worth 5 points for completion. 

The second survey is a mid-term evaluation to help me (1) monitor the progression of the course and (2) identify changes to improve the quality for the current and future semesters. This survey will be due March 3 and is also worth 5 points. Although I cannot award credit or bonus for the end-of-term evaluations (SEEQs), I rely heavily on these for feedback and continuously change my courses based on them. 


Extra Credit <br>
It will be possible for students to earn extra credit points during the semester. These opportunities may include impromptu, optional homework assignments and in-class groupwork. The maximum bonus points that can be used is 10.

Communicating with Your Instructor and Teaching Assistants<br>
We are here to offer assistance. You are welcome to make an appointment to meet with us or email us at any time. We will do our best to respond to you within 48 hours of your contact.  The best way to contact us is via Messages in Canvas. All correspondence should include PSYCH 231 in the subject line.

Comment on Attendance and Course Work<br>
It is strongly suggested that you attend class. However, we are aware that emergencies and unforeseen circumstances may arise that can prevent attendance. If you miss class, check Canvas. Class lectures may be recorded and posted under the Media Gallery on Canvas, and the lecture slides are always posted in the Modules (in the first folder and in the weekly folder). 

You may tell us in advance of an absence, but ultimately, it is easier to contact us AFTER an absence(s) to arrange for access to make up assignments. Before contacting our grad TA, check your Canvas Grades or the weekly Module to see what you missed. Then, list those assignments and the general reason for your absence in your message to your TA. 
For full credit, all make-up work should be submitted within one week of RETURNING to class following an absence, not from the date of the absence(s). You may and should make up any missed assignment. 
If you need additional help, please discuss it with either TAs or instructor, or seek help from Penn State Tutoring services: Tutoring | Penn State Learning 

Acknowledgements of Historical Context<br>
Historically, psychology has exhibited gender biases, notably through male dominance in academia, leading to research that often-overlooked women's experiences. Early studies frequently centered on male subjects, with findings generalized to all, thereby reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes. Women were underrepresented both as researchers and subjects, resulting in gaps in understanding their mental health needs. The rise of feminist psychology and gender studies has challenged these biases, promoting more inclusive research that considers diverse gender experiences. Recognizing these historical biases is essential for developing a more equitable psychological science.


Religious and Cultural Observances<br>
Individuals who have religious or cultural observances that conflict with classes or class assignments should inform the instructor or TA as soon as possible. We will do our best to accommodate your schedule, and as with any absence, you are permitted to make up missed assignments.

Student Conduct<br>
Occasionally, some of the topics discussed in our class may be controversial or of a sensitive nature. While students may disagree with others, all students, while engaged in classroom activities and electronic correspondence, shall respect the rights of others. We will be inclusive and respectful of opinions shared without malice or the intention to harm others.
In addition, our classroom is not a bedroom, a lunchroom, or a place to conduct online shopping, etc. (No one wants to watch you sleep or hear you snore.) Talking in class during lectures is also very distracting for everyone. Please silence your cell phones when you come to class and put them out of sight. Similarly, I permit computers and tablets in class for completing assignments, but that privilege will be revoked if you are performing activities unrelated to class and distract your peers. 

COVID Safety Information<br>
Students experiencing any illness, especially COVID-19 related symptoms, should not attend class in person. Your health should be first priority. Those students needing extended absences are strongly encouraged to contact a health care provider and then their instructor as soon as possible to discuss reasonable accommodations. Please check the COVD-19 Dashboard (https://virusinfo.psu.edu/covid-19-dashboard/) for updates.

Extended Absences and Student Resources<br>
During your enrollment at Penn State, unforeseen challenges may arise. If you ever need to miss an extended amount of class in such a circumstance, please notify your instructor so you can determine together the best course of action to make up missed work. If your situation rises to a level of difficulty you cannot manage on your own with faculty support, reach out to the Student Care & Advocacy office by phone at (814-863-2020) or email them at StudentCare@psu.edu. Office hours are Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

Technology in the Classroom<br>
Although I highly encourage you to hand-write your notes, laptop and tablet use will be permitted in our classroom. I would rather not ban devices, so I encourage you to use them wisely and purposefully. In terms of note-taking, research suggests that the process of handwriting or at least formulating notes in your own words is always more effective than typing lectures verbatim. On the other hand, we will complete activities in class, and making submissions on Canvas using tablets or laptops can be beneficial. If you need a laptop, consider contacting PSU IT to request one. 

Class Cancellations<br>
In the event that classes are canceled by the University, we will pick up where we left off when classes resume. If we must cancel class for unforeseen circumstances, we will send a Canvas Message to you prior to our class time and post a Canvas Announcement. We will attempt to give you as much advance notice as possible.  As with college cancellations, at our next class meeting we will resume where we left off.

Students with Disabilities<br>
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact the Student Disability Resources. For further information regarding policies, rights, and responsibilities please visit the Student Disability Resources (SDR) website at: www.equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/. Instructors should be notified as early in the semester as possible regarding the need for reasonable accommodations.

Diversity Statement<br>
I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect.  All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.  Penn State is “committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others” as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance.

Students, faculty, or staff who experience or witness a possible bias motivated incident are urged to report the incident immediately by doing one of the following:<br>

Nondiscrimination Statement<br>
The Pennsylvania State University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons.  It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.  Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.

Direct all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to the Affirmative Action Office, 328 Boucke Building, Email: aao@psu.edu, Tel: 814-863-0471.

Mandated Reporting Statement<br>
Penn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.  For more information regarding the University's policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu. Additionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.

Academic integrity<br>
Penn State defines academic integrity as “the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner” (Senate Policy 49-20). Therefore, an academic integrity violation is “an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.” Dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated in this course. Dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without permission from the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students. Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor before submitting work.   

Students facing allegations of academic misconduct should not drop the course; those who do will be added to the course again and will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. If the allegations are dismissed, then the drop will be permitted. Students found responsible for academic misconduct often receive academic sanctions, which can be severe, and put themselves at risk for disciplinary sanctions assigned by the University's Office of Student Conduct (see Senate Policy G-9). Students with questions about academic integrity should visit http://www.la.psu.edu/current-students/undergraduate-students/education/academic-integrity.
 
Also, you may not share any information from this course (including notes and assignments) with others who are not currently registered for the course. All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct and/or liable under Federal and State laws. Students should also consider seriously the negative consequences of sharing their login credentials with others, which is a violation of University policy.
